abbreviation: .....
---
In collaboration with San Diego State University, the University of Chicago, the University of California, Riverside, and our team here at UMD, this project is developing a sustainable open source ecosystem for Spatial Data Science. The project capitalizes on the existing efforts, resources, and contributions that have resulted in the Python spatial analysis library (PySAL) and seeks to enhance the number of developers, users, and overal contributions within the ecosystem. This is being done by strengthening connections between the ecosystem and academia, science, education, government, and industry, through several specialist meetings and other outreach activities.
