role: PhD Student
priority: 3
bio: Mengyu's interests include spatiotemporal theories and applications, big
  data, spatial data science, as well as geospatial modeling with machine
  learning. As a Ph.D student, I am eager to use those above to explore how
  humans perceive, interact with, and change space/environments. Particularly, I
  have a strong interest in bridging geospatial modeling with criminology, human
  mobility and health.
