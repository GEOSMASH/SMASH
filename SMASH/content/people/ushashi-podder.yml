role: PhD Student; Member
priority: 3
bio: My interests include geospatial visualization, spatial data science,
  spatial modeling, and machine learning with applications in urban,
  transportation and health geography. I aim to expand my skills and apply those
  to study the mobility patterns, behaviors and activities of humans across
  space. I also aim to apply my skills to the health sector to study infectious
  diseases by taking into account human mobility patterns. Bike sharing system
  and sustainable transportation is also an arena of interest that I want to
  explore.
