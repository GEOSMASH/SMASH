title: Thematic Session (SDS Symposium 23')
subtitle: "Leveraging Geographic Context at Multiple Scales: The Salience of the Neighborhood in Statistical Learning & Causal Analysis"
bodyContent: "In cutting-edge spatial learning methods, the 'neighborhood' is often used as a way topool information, improving predictions and regularising estimates. But, thecorrespondence between the statistically-useful neighborhoods that our methods identifyand the actual neighborhoods that matter to people is generally unknown andunder-examined. Instead, new methods proceed apace, coming up with new, better,more efficient ways of learning from context. This session seeks to provide a platform forthose interested in neighborhood effects themselves and their correspondence with theneighborhoods that are salient for individual behavior. In addition, this session seeks toprovide a home for those interested in developing new local spatial learning methods thatlearn from geographical context to improve predictions or regularise estimates."
