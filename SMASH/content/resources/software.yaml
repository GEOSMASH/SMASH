  ## PySAL Packages


  The Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL) is a federation of packages for handling, exploring, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data. For more info, check out the [project web page](https://pysal.org/) and [this paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gean.12276).


  ### mgwr: multiscale geographically weighted regression


  This package provides an API for geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR). [Code can be found here](https://github.com/pysal/mgwr) and a [practical tutorial here](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/6/269/htm).


  ### spint: spatial interaction


  This package provides an API for the calibration of spatial interaction models. [Code can be found here](https://github.com/pysal/spint) and a [practical tutorial here](https://openjournals.wu.ac.at/region/paper_175_revised/175.html).


  ### spglm: sparse generalized linear models


  This package provides an API for generalized linear models that are optimized for sparse design matrices with many zero values. [Code can be found here](https://github.com/pysal/spglm).
