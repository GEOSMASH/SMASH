bio: "Recent advancements in local eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods open up new avenues to leverage the flexibility and accuracy of machine learning models for studying spatial phenomena. These methods offer model explainability at the individual level, which helps us gain insights into how individuals behave and interact within specific spatial and covariate contexts. This short presentation will introduce methods that can measure contextual effects within machine learning models. The combination of model flexibility, accuracy, and interpretability holds great promise in advancing our understanding of complex spatial processes."
