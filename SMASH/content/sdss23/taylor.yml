bio: Taylor is an assistant professor in the department of geographical sciences
  at the University of Maryland. He broadly interested in characterizing spatial
  patterns and processes through the use of quantitative geographic methods,
  which typically falls under the banners of spatial analysis and spatial
  statistics, geographic information science, and spatial data science. Overall,
  my research his targeted the development of multivariate spatial statistics
  and how they can be used to capture how relationships change by spatial and
  temporal contexts. This includes issues of theory, interpretation,
  scalability, and integration of traditional geographic models with novel
  "big" datasets, as well as applications in public health, crime, urban
  mobility, and transportation systems.
