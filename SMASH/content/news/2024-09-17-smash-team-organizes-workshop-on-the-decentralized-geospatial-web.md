Several team members contributed to organizing and hosting a workshop through the EASIER Data Initiative project funded by the [Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web](https://ffdweb.org), [Astral](https://astral.global), and the [International GeoCenter](https://intgeocenter.org). The workshop explores the nexus of the geospatial web, the decentralized web, and open geospatial science. More information, including the motivation, event details, video recordings, and executive summary can be found on the [workshop website](https://workshop.easierdata.org).
