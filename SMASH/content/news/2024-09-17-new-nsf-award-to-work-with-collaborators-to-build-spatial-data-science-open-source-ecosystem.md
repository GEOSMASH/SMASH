The SMASH team will collaborate with teams from SDSU, UChicago, and UCRiverside to develop a spatial data science open source ecosystem around the [PySAL](https://pysal.org) project and strengthen connections within government, industry, science, and education. The goal is to develop a sustainable ecosystem in terms of finances,  infrastructure, users, and developers. Several workshops, amongst other activities, will help to scope the ecosystem.
