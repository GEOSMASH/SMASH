Spatial Data Science in an Age of Scientific Disruption

Location
UCSB Geog Department
December 8-9, 2023

The objective of this [Specialist Meeting](https://spatial.ucsb.edu/events/all/2023/spatial-data-science-age-scientific-disruption) is to discuss GIScience leadership and response to science disruptions and to develop two collaboratively authored manuscripts on the research and teaching directions of the field. 

It was great to see old friends, meet new ones, and participate in the event while visiting sunny Santa Barbara.
