Dr. Oshan had the opportunity to contribute to a [workshop in December](https://geosmash.net/news/2024-09-11-dr-oshan-attends-ucsb-workshop-on-disruptions-spatial-data-science) that produced two publications. The first of these is [now out (and open access!)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2024.2405191), which outlines a research agenda for GIScience in a time of disruptions.
