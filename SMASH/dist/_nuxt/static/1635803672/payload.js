Yet, the processes that lead to this variation may vary in different spatial contexts, and statistical approaches are needed that account for this variation. In this study, the researchers develop statistical methods that address correlations between spatially proximate outcomes, as well as open source software to make these approaches freely available to other scholars. Specifically, the researchers develop methods for the statistical modeling of data at multiple scales by advancing multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) methods, which allows the effects of predictor variables to vary based on their spatial context. This approach address known challenges to statistical inferences, specifically that regression models may indicate biased and contrary effects if the models do not adequately account for the scale and structure in the dataset. Additional aims include new methods for adjusting inferences when multiple hypotheses are examined and the implementation of diagnostic tools for examining the robustness of model assumptions. To demonstrate the methods, the researchers apply the modeling approach to empirical datasets with spatial structure, such as mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, teen pregnancy rates, and voting trends in recent elections."}]}]},dir:g,path:"\u002Fnews\u002F2021-08-01-Article1 copy 2",extension:o,createdAt:"2021-09-01T23:56:12.384Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-24T19:20:56.342Z"},{slug:"2021-10-28-smaart-seminar-series-invites-dr-john-hipp",image:"\u002Fstatic\u002Fuploads\u002Fsmaart.png",imageAlt:"smaart",title:"SMAART Seminar Series Invites Dr. John Hipp",authors:[i],date:"2021-08-10T15:04:34.722Z",toc:[],body:{type:j,children:[{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Dr. John Hipp will give an invited talk on \"Accounting For Spatial Mobility: Consequences For Ecological Studies Of Crime\".

The challenge with smaller units is that offenders, targets, and guardians all can (and do) move about the spatial landscape. As a consequence, we propose that there is no single appropriate (or best) geographic unit in which to aggregate data. Based on existing criminological theory we propose that three different spatial patterns characterize how we should consider aggregating measures: 1) decay patterns; 2) mixing in an environment; 3) relational patterns. We discuss the strategy we will use with data in Southern California from 2009-11. We create measures based on theoretical expectations of spatial patterns, although the actual spatial extent is empirically determined in this study based on relationships with crime at the street segment level. There is a need for researchers to create aggregated measures that explicitly account for the mobility patterns of persons when studying the ecology of crime."}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Please Register Here:"}]},{type:a,value:" "},{type:b,tag:h,props:{href:q,rel:[k,l,m],target:n},children:[{type:a,value:q}]}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:"img",props:{alt:"",src:"https:\u002F\u002Fgeospatial.umd.edu\u002Fsites\u002Fgeospatial.umd.edu\u002Ffiles\u002Fusers\u002Ftoshan\u002Fsmaart_hipp.png"},children:[]}]}]},dir:g,path:"\u002Fnews\u002F2021-10-28-smaart-seminar-series-invites-dr-john-hipp",extension:o,createdAt:"2021-10-28T21:27:54.572Z",updatedAt:"2021-11-01T21:12:21.473Z"}]},"data-v-c9de252c:0":{mediaIcons:[{name:"YouTube",icon:"logos:youtube-icon",link:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002F"},{name:"Github",icon:"mdi:github",link:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FGEOSMASH"}],footerText:"**SMASH 2021**"}},mutations:void 0}}("text","element","p","\n","\u002Fprojects\u002Findex","strong","\u002Fnews","a","Dr. Taylor Oshan","root","nofollow","noopener","noreferrer","_blank",".md","ic:round-file-copy","https:\u002F\u002Fbit.ly\u002F3v1fQ0M")));
